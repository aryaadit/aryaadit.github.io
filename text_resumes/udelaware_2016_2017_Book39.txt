EMPLOYMENT HISTORY  
 
Graduate Research Assistant under Professor Thomas H. Epps, III  
- Thesis Topic: Block polymers for lithium-ion battery electrolytes 
- Synthesized novel ion-conducting polymers using ATRP and anionic polymerization techniques  
- Characterized materials by proton NMR, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), small-angle x-ray 
scattering (SAXS), neutron reflectivity (NR), AC impedance spectroscopy, and transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) 
- Selected to the 2016 National School on Neutron and X-ray Scattering at Argonne National Lab and Oak 
Ridge National Lab 
- Mentored two undergraduate students (Bonnie Limpawuchara, Christine Castagna) 
- Laboratory safety manager 
 
Larson Scholars Undergraduate Research Fellow with Professor Robert H. Grubbs       June 2012-2013  
- Researched the self-assembly of asymmetric brush block copolymers for photonic crystals 
- Performed polymerizations via ATRP and ROMP,  
- Characterized samples with NMR, SEC, sample casting, and scanning electron microscopy 
- Received a grade of A for senior thesis  
 
Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow with Professor Bradley Olsen (MIT) 
- Researched the use of elastin-like proteins as a method for directing enzyme self-assembly  
- Performed cloning, protein expression, protein purification, sample casting, and SAXS experiments to 
determine the efficacy of the self-assembly  
- Researched the effect on rheological properties of a physical double network hydrogel for artificial 
cartilage  
 
TEACHING EXPERIENCE 
 
Graduate Teaching Assistant for graduate level Introduction to Polymers  
- Graded weekly homework assignments and created solution keys 
- Provided weekly office hours and review sessions before exams 
- Designed and presented two lectures (Kinetics of Step Growth Polymerization, Overview of Controlled 
Radical Polymerizations)
