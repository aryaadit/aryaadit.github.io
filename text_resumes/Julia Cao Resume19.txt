Gaussian Classifiers for Digits and Spam                                                                                                                                Feb 2017 
• 
• 
•  Classified the digits in the test set on the basis of posterior probabilities, with two different approaches: Linear discriminant analysis 

Built classifiers based on Gaussian discriminant analysis for digit recognition 
Taking pixel values as features, fit a Gaussian distribution to each digit class using maximum likelihood estimation (cid:1)  

Jun 2017 – Aug 2017  

(LDA) and Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and used k-fold cross validation to tune for the hyperparameters 

                                                                                                                             Sep 2016 – Dec 2016 

Built a 4-datatype relational database in Java, with a buffer manager, serialization and deserialization of data for storage on pages 
Implemented a B+ Tree index, which supports search, insertion, and iteration through the database 

Relational Database System 
• 
• 
•  Achieved efficient function-oriented query using Block Nested Loop Join, Grace Hash Join, and Index Join, etc. 
• 
• 

Supported optimal query plan selection by mapping from a set of tables to a join query operator that corresponds to the lowest cost  
Implemented lock protocol to solve concurrency control problems 

Image Compression with Spark                                                                                                                                                 Dec 2016 
• 
•  Used Apache Spark to convert each image from BGR color space to YCbCr color space, and to apply DCT, reverse DCT, 

Implemented a scheme using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to perform lossy video compression (cid:1)  

Quantization, and Dequantization to 8x8 sub-blocks of each image 

•  Utilizaed Spark to patch the processed 8x8 blocks back to the original size 

Stellar Graph 
•  Worked on data visualization for Stellar, a non-profit platform which provides unbanked people with financial access, during a social 

                                                                                                                                  Apr 2016
