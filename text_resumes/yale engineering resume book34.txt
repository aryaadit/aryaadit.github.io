Biotechnology research project through Sacred Heart Academy 

        2011-2012 
Position:  Extracted,  purified,  and  sequenced  the  actin  gene  of  Limulus  polyphemus  and  Styela  clava;  found 
correlation of actin gene to mitochondrial diseases; presented data (NEERS, MA 2012 and UMDF, MD 2012)  
Community service: Lobbied Connecticut State Senator to support funding for mitochondrial disease research. A 
bill to fund mitochondrial disease research was ultimately passed
