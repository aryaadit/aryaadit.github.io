RESEARCH AND PROJECTS 
User-centric Scheduling of Cooperated Offloading Workload                                                                 Yale University, New Haven 
Supervisor: Wenjun Hu, Assistant Professor                                                                                                                  Oct. 2016 – Present 
Ø  This project aims to propose an on-device user-centric offloading scheduler to leverage the correlation among different offloading 

workloads within the same device, and therefore, improve the overall performance of the mobile system.  
 

Auto-Tuning Fine-Grained Parallelism in Data-Analytics System with Libra                                      Yale University, New Haven 
Supervisor: Wenjun Hu, Assistant Professor                                                                                                             Oct. 2015 – Oct. 2016 
Ø  We propose Libra, to auto-tune job partitioning in data analytics systems. The key observation is that there is an optimal task size 
per application (stage). This optimal varies by the application logic, and so we need to dynamically determine task sizes during 
run time. 
 

Towards Fertile, Flexible and Future-proof Enterprise Networks                                                                            Tsinghua, Beijing 
Supervisor: Jun Bi, Professor                                                                                                                                   Sep. 2014 – Jan. 2015 
Ø  This project is part of China's National High-tech R&D Program ("863" Program): designed, implemented and operated a testbed 
platform for innovative network architectures, protocols and applications. The current design and implementation are inspired 
by the SDN paradigm. 

Ø  We worked on the open-function network devices (software based). The extended OVS software switches perform not only 

packet forwarding, but also protocol-oblivious actions, state maintenance, third-party app agent hosting, etc. 

Ø  Provided a reliable and efficient channel to bridge controller and underling datapaths

Supervisor: Wei Xu, Assistant Professor                                                                                                                  Feb. 2014 – Feb. 2015 
Ø  This project aims to use Multicore Processor and NetFPGA to realize: 10G network link emulation, Wire-speed Network Packets 

Capturing and Replay, Network Traffic Shaper and Hardware-based Network Fault Injection 

Ø  We worked on using NetFPGA to realize the wire-speed network packets capturing, delay and replay. I took the charge of writing
