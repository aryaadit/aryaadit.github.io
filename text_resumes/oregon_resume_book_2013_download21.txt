Work Experience  
Oregon State University: Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Health Physics  
Hydro Mechanical Fuel Test Facility 
Graduate Research Assistant 
Fall 2011-Present 

•Research and Development specific to the Hydro Mechanical Fuel Test Facility, an ASME NQA-1 
(Nuclear Quality Assurance-1) compliant program. This work involves the hydro-mechanical 
validation of a prototype plate type low enrichment fuel for high performance research reactors. 
Specifically, the characterization of flow induced vibrations, deflections, stress analysis, and other 
phenomena caused by non-uniform flow past plate type fuel.
