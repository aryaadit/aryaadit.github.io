Research & Industry Experience
GRAB Lab, Aaron Dollar, Yale University, New Haven, CT.
Current: developing a novel Stewart platform-based robotic hand for dexterous 6-DOF, in-hand manip-
ulation. Previous: designed a reconﬁgurable truss system for rapid assembly of lightweight, high-rigidity
structures assembled by a robotic manipulator to form arbitrary 3D geometries.

June 2015
to present

Summer 2016 Ekso Bionics, Richmond, CA.

Designed a cycle-testing apparatus to cycle the company’s industrial zeroG Arm system through its full
range of motion and simulate real-world loading scenarios.

Summer 2014 Robot Locomotion Group, Russ Tedrake, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cam-

bridge, MA.
Developed a computer model of a robotic bird for motion planning and simulation based on accurate
anatomical dimensions and physical properties from live birds.

Summer 2013 Surgical Navigation and Robotics Lab, Nobuhiko Hata, Harvard Medical School,

Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA.
Developed a proof-of-concept medical device prototype to optically measure the insertion depth of a
biopsy needle using an optical sensor during robotic, MRI-guided surgeries.

Summer 2012 Xu Lab, Qiaobing Xu, Tufts University, Biomedical Engineering, Medford, MA.

Designed a three-dimensional perfusion bioreactor for ex-vivo liver tissue drug delivery screening.
