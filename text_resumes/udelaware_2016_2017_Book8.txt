I am fluent in German and English and have dual citizenship. I am interested in renewable energy and 
green chemistry, as well as microbiology. I am passionate about science communication and have made 
every effort to improve my presentation skills. I enjoy the outdoors, playing ultimate Frisbee, rock 
climbing, traveling the world and I love to learn foreign languages.
