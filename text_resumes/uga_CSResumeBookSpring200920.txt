For pseudoknot-free structures, ncRNA search can be effective based on the covariance model and CYK-type dynamic programming. However, the computational difficulty in aligning an RNA sequence to a pseudoknot has prohibited fast and accurate search of arbitrary RNA structures. Our work, RNATOPS, introduced a graph model for RNA pseudoknots and proposed to solve the structureâ€“sequence alignment by graph optimization. Given k candidate regions in the target sequence for each of the n stems in the structure, we could compute a best alignment in time O(ktn) based upon a tree width t decomposition of the structure graph. However, to implement this method to programs that can routinely perform fast yet accurate RNA pseudoknot searches, we need novel heuristics to ensure that, without degrading the accuracy, only a small number of stem candidates need to be examined and a tree decomposition of a small tree width can always be found for the structure graph. Test result shows that RNATOPS can do fast searches on prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes for specific RNA structures of medium to large sizes, including pseudoknots, with high sensitivity and high specificity.

(cid:190) Detection of vehicle license plate is very important in Vehicle License Plate Recognition System. In this project, a novel classifier fusion-based detection algorithm is proposed. After locating candidate license plate regions, features of these regions are extracted for the optimal feature subset by exhaustive search strategy. Based on classifier fusion theory, Simple Average (SA) method is compared with two Weighted Average (WA) methods. Experimental results show that after reducing the dependency of features, SA method works better. The most three important features of the license plate regions are obtained in the experiment and our algorithm can be applied in real-time applications and robust in filtering out false plate regions.
