I am a biomedical engineering undergraduate interested in how innovative, affordable biotechnology can someday expand modern 
healthcare into medically underserved parts of the world, and how an understanding of research science can influence international 
healthcare policy. I have international experience, some laboratory experience, and I am seeking to deepen my understanding for 
the clinical biosciences and how laboratory research can propel our biomedical frontiers, particularly in fields like tissue engineering 
and nanoparticle drug delivery, into a more equitable future.

Working with doctors around Cusco, Peru set up mobile clinics where preventative healthcare and prescription medications 
are made available to communities that are medically underserved. Specifics of position include training students in clinic 
work such as taking vitals, distributing pharmaceuticals, and explaining illnesses, as well as teaching basic Spanish and 
healthcare policy, in order prepare them to volunteer in clinics and hospitals when the group travels to Peru. 

Health Team Chairman  
Focused on consolidating public health efforts in northwest Cameroon and creating sanitation education lesson plans for 
students in rural schools. Assisted in construction for clean water infrastructure and carried out water quality testing and 
community health and disease surveys in Rohvitangitaa, Cameroon in May 2016.

Laboratory Assistant in Protein Crystallography   
Assisted researchers in the areas of biophysics and biomedical technology at Brookhaven National Lab who were performing 
x-ray crystallography on proteins using the National Synchrotron Light Source particle accelerator. Worked on accelerator 
beamline, assisted in preparation of protein crystals, and used modeling software to process structural data collected from 
hemoglobin.

My interests are at the intersection of biomedicine and international healthcare. I am fascinated by the potential that 
biomaterials and other new sciences offer us, but I'm also committed to finding ways that our technology can employed for 
universal betterment. I pursue opportunities that offer practical insights into the interplay between laboratory research and 
public implementation, with a specific focus on their futures for use in the developing world. I also enjoy being a 
communicator for others, and am confident in my ability to synthesize and express new ideas in clinical or casual settings. I 
volunteer as a tour guide in a campus historical art museum, which is a great way to practice researching and interfacing with 
people, and many of my extracurricular roles have me studying new technologies, medicines, or other ideas and expressing 
them to organize and coordinate a goal.
