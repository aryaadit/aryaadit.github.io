•  Establishing a three-dimensional (3D), hydrogel-based culture system that incorporates collagen 

mimetic peptides (CMPs) to impart a fibrillar structure over multiple length scales 

•  Designing and characterizing CMPs to promote self-assembly from triple helices to fibrils in solution 
•  Determining mechanical properties of hydrogel-based materials with covalently incorporated CMPs

• 

Induced polarization of Tumor Associated Macrophages using interleukin-4 and lipopolysaccharide and 
incubated with functionalized polystyrene particles to reverse polarization   

•  Performed various biochemical assays to determine extent of cell repolarization 

o  Determined that particles did not change phenotype, but induced changes in pro- or anti-

inflammatory markers
