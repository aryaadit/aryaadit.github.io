PERSONAL SUMMARY

E-Mail: alecive87@gmail.com, alessandro.roncone@yale.edu

The central motivating theme of my research is endowing robots with enough communication, perception and
control capabilities in order for them to proficiently interact with humans in practical, near future applications. I
develop technologies that equip robots with the skills to partner with humans in their daily activities, with the aim
of eventually replacing them in dangerous, repetitive or burdensome tasks. Importantly, my goal is not to advance
the state of the art in a specific area. Rather, I explicitly focus on capitalizing the state of the art in perception,
control and human-robot interaction and to shape the research landscape toward the development of technologies
that enable close, natural, extended cooperation with humans.

My research has spanned multiple fields, bridging the gap between robotics, human robot interaction, and
artificial intelligence. Over the years, I have worked on i) exploring the breadths of how tactile systems can improve
perception in the nearby space, ii) implementing state of the art control systems for humanoid robots, and iii)
investigating how communication can steer and improve human-robot collaborative tasks.

RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

2015-present - POSTDOCTORAL ASSOCIATE - SOCIAL ROBOTICS LAB, COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT,
YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CT, USA

I am focusing on the development of bidirectional, natural communication between the robot and the human in
the context of human-robot collaborative tasks. I am working toward the implementation of a more natural and
intuitive interaction, in order for it to be more efficient and effective, as well as less demanding for the human
partner.
2010-2015 - ICUB FACILITY - ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA, GENOVA, IT

I was interested in the exploitation of the peripersonal space model I implemented during my Ph.D., by focusing
toward two types of applications: i) better, richer body representations ii) distributed motor control via whole-body
awareness. Furthermore, I extended the gaze stabilization framework I developed during my Ph.D. by integrating it
with an existing gaze controller. I was also contributing to a human-robot interaction project aimed at developing
natural interaction(s) between the iCub humanoid robot and humans.
