APPOINTMENTS

Graduate Research Assistant (((((Yale Universityyyyy))))):

July 2015 – Current
Investigating soot formation in diﬀusion and partially premixed counterﬂow ﬂames at
elevated pressures up to 5MPa, incorporating a wide range of diagnostics to study both
gas phase kinetics and soot inception/growth.

Graduate Research Assistant (((((Universityyyyy of Central Florida))))):

May 2014 – May 2015
1) Collaboration with NASA Kennedy Space Center Launch Services to experimentally

measure the rate of vapor migration into a payload fairing on a launch vehicle.

2) Developing a low temperature, vapor-phase deposition technique of modiﬁed graphene

oxide using a coupled evaporation-to-condensation transfer process.

3) Studying steady-state water droplet evaporation on a heated substrate systematically

correlate the eﬀects of a droplets contact angle on the evaporation rate.

Undergggggraduate Research Assistant:

Nov. 2012 – May 2014
Investigating water microdroplet evaporation on heated substrates, focusing on both con-
trolling a droplets contact line dynamics and validating numerical models.
