RESEARCH AND WORK EXPERIENCE 
Yale University Gonzalez Lab: Microparticle Encapsulation of Neural Stem Cells   

 

                   August 2016-present 
Position: Enhanced and conducted a microparticle encapsulation using neural stem cells to promote neurovascular 
regeneration in stroke subjects. Collaborated with multiple teams  and presented data/suggestions based off my 
experimental conclusions

Medtronic: Biomedical and Analytical Chemistry R&D Intern 

      Winter 2017, Summer 2016 
Position:  Evaluated  biocompatibility  of  a  novel  adhesive  through  cytotoxicity,  cell-mesh  interaction,  cell 
integration,  wettability,  and  chemical  elution  studies.  Data  generated  will  influence  developmental  process. 
Conducted a 3-D wound healing assay using collagen hydrogels in order to observe cell infiltration in a tissue-like 
environment demonstrating the feasibility of a product concept 
Key skills:  cytotoxicity, SEM, histology, contact angle, elution test, collagen hydrogel formation 

UConn Health Center: Electrical Stimulation Plate for Neuronal Tissue Regeneration 

            Fall 2015-Summer 2016 
Position: Senior design project to design a novel cell culture plate coupled with electrical stimulation using ionically 
conductive polymers for promotion of axonal regeneration when electric charge is supplied. Cell studies and image 
analysis show promising results of stem cell differentiation and further evaluations are ongoing. Presented device 
and data (NEBEC, NY 2016 and ASAIOfyi, CA 2016) winning 2nd place at Senior Design Demonstration Day 
Key skills: SolidWorks, electrical stimulation, QuickField, design, machining, tissue testing

 Collagen Network Research Methods (Fall 2015-Spring 2016)              2015-2016 
Position: Research of existing literature to identify known mechanisms of collagen fibrillogenesis and collagen 
network  formation.  Research  protocol  development,  continuing  to  benchtop  studies  creating  a  hyaluronic  acid 
hydrogel. Literature synthesis will be submitted as part of a manuscript for peer-reviewed journal 
Key skills: hyaluronic acid hydrogel, protocol formation, collagen network formation, literature synthesis 

 

 

 

Medtronic: Biomedical and Analytical Chemistry R&D Intern 

    Winter 2016,   Summer 2015 
Position: Validated a custom tissue culture protocol for immunohistochemistry using several cell lines and target 
proteins through Western Blot and IHC staining for evaluation of protocols, product components and shipping 
conditions. Cultured staphylococcus bacteria and evaluated viability and other test conditions to support test method 
development 
Key  skills:  immunohistochemistry,  Western  Blot,  bacteria  assays,  cancer  cell  studies,  biomarker  expression, 
histological tissue processing techniques  

Covidien: Biomedical and Analytical Chemistry R&D Intern 

  Summer 2014 
Position: Performed cell proliferation studies, viability staining and fluorescent imaging, and collagen production 
studies as well as evaluated cell interaction and integration with non-woven polymeric material used for staple line 
reinforcements to support development efforts 
Key skills: cell culture and cell studies, fluorescent microscopy and image analysis, SEM imaging, histology
