2009 – 2013 

•  Thesis: Engineering carbon and nitrogen self-sufficient co-cultures by adaptive evolution 
•  Constructed a metabolic network model and performed 13C-MFA for the first time of the nitrogen-fixing 

microbe, Azotobacter vinelandii.  Designed nitrogen self-sufficient co-cultures using A. vinelandii.

Nov 2013 – Aug 2014 

•  Objective:  Development of iron-fortified, cisgenic indica rice with Genetic Transformation Lab (GTL) 
•  Streamlined high-throughput assay to quantify iron content in rice endosperm. 
•  Quantified effect of drought, salinity, and elevated CO2 on grain nutrition via ICP-OES to assess 

implications of climate change on biofortification. 

•  Developed public communications pieces on rice biofortification for IRRI’s Healthier Rice campaign.

Jun 2011 – Oct 2013 

•  Thesis:  Metabolism of dietary, anticancer glucosinolates by the gut microbe, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 

and implications for human health 

•  Designed and implemented high-throughput screen of a transposon mutant library.  Identified microbial 

genes required to metabolize target plant anticancer compounds.
