Personal Information:
 I have been working as an Electronic Associate at the Cloquet Walmart for the past 3 years, diagnosing, troubleshooting, 
recommending upgrades in both hardware and software, and assisting in repairs. Have spent seven plus years building 
networks and computers, repairing computers, trouble shooting all sorts of issues, including printers and other network 
peripherals worked with all Windows, Macintosh, and Linux based systems. I am an extremely quick learner when it comes to 
any technology, and technology related fields. I have had a lot of experience with multiple different forms of electricity (home, 
automotive, and renewable) and technologies. I enjoy working on my house, automotive repairs and restoration, computer 
and technical services, and anything to do with our Minnesota outdoors.
