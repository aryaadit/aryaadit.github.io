  Used in-house flash photolysis set-up to probe reaction dynamics of one election oxidation of guanine bases in DNA 

•− or SO4

•− radicals 

by CO3
Identified products of single and double strand DNA oxidation using HPLC, enzymatic digestion, and MALDI-TOF 
techniques

              May 2010-December 2011 

Identified novel compounds produced by gene 101700 in fungus Aspergillus flavus using column chromatography and 
NMR techniques 

  Once structure was determined, developed synthesis plan and synthesized compounds; followed with HPLC/MS 

  Tested activity of compounds with bioassays to determine antibacterial properties  

verification
