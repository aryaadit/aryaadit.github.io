I am a computer science researcher specializing in database management systems. I have been focusing on large scale
distributed database systems architecture and implementation, as well as transaction processing in multi-cores and main
memory database systems. Most of my research work has been documented in top tier publications.
I also have strong engineering skills on systems programming, and I like to build systems.
