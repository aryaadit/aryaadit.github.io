  2013-present 

           2012-2017 (expected) 

      2008-2012 

biomass composition quantification and use of RNA and glycogen for 13C metabolic flux analysis 

• Performed comprehensive physiological and fluxomic characterizations of ~50 E. coli central carbon 

metabolism knockout mutants, identifying novel reactions and patterns of metabolic responses 

• This large data set will be applied for the development of advanced kinetic metabolic models and 

strain design tools
