draw inferences about mechanistic pathways in this important biomass-related reaction 

 
              

•  Performed catalyst activity studies in a custom microreactor with on-line sampling to confirm 

 
  

 

 

 

 

the mechanistic insights obtained from IR and characterization studies 

•  Applied the results of the mechanistic study to rationally design a new class of highly active 

and selective catalysts for lactate dehydration 
Identified and fully investigated a novel gas-solid ion exchange process between adsorbed 
organic molecules and alkali-metal form zeolites with broad potential applications 

• 

•  Expertise: High vacuum infrared spectroscopy, microreactor design and construction, 

reaction engineering, gas chromatography, catalyst characterization  

•  Skills and Proficiencies: FTIR, XRD, TPD, N2 adsorption, and other characterization 

techniques. Working knowledge of MATLAB, ASPEN Plus and HYSYS, data analysis software 
(including Igor, Origin, and Excel), and Microsoft Office

•  Designed and developed a dynamic model of a Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) unit 

operation using AspenTech’s HYSYS software package 

•  Collaborated with a multi-national team to identify and satisfy appropriate design 

specifications and incorporate the TSA model into a pre-existing model of a complete Air 
Separation Plant, used for the production of high purity N2, O2 and Ar
