Research Experience

2016–present Graduate Research Assistant, Hyder Lab, Yale University, New Haven, CT.

Do work primarily in algorithmic analysis in experimental radiology and MRI. Performed Lorentzian lineshape analysis
on tumor BIRDS images. Presently establishing the utility of Na-based BIRDS imaging in vitro for further work in
mapping Na-centric tumor physiology.

2015–2016 Graduate Research Assistant, Adie Lab, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.

Developed framework for dynamic real-time GPU-accelerated optical coherence elastography (OCE), with work primarily
done using Microsoft Visual Studio and the nVIDA CUDA language.

2015 Summer Research Assistant, Hasan Lab, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ.

Performed computational ab initio calculations of electronic structures for diﬀerent materials, in particular topological
insulators, and subsequent quantum analysis of the discrete superconductive surface states

2013 Undergraduate Research Assistant, Hernandez Lab, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.

Wrote image analysis software to determine probability of fracture high-resolution input bone image. Used MATLAB
extensively to generate image array and calculate maximal principal strain values at possible fracture sites

2012 Undergraduate Research Assistant, Kelley Lab, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY & Jicamarca, Peru.

Studied eﬀects of the fair-weather electric ﬁeld to observe charge eﬀects due to solar winds on the atmosphere. Used
MATLAB/NIDAQ interfacing for data input and analysis
Work Experience

2016–present Co-Head of Quantitative Trading and Research, Armitage Capital, New Haven, CT.

Development of self-learning regression model to determine optimal buy and sell points for stock market. Current
phase: static and dynamic testing in a makeshift stock market simulation environment.

2013, 2014 Technology Summer Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co., Jersey City, NJ.

Redesigned regression testing framework to reduce end-of-day test times 100-fold. Also wrote JSP web applications to
facilitate trade reporting to FINRA.

2012–2014 Ground Segment Subteam Member, Cornell University Satellite Team (CUSAT), Ithaca, NY.

Design of JSatTrak software in Java for the CUSAT and Violet teams to communicate with passing satellites overhead
both local and remote ground stations.
Project Experience

Jan 2017 Biomimetic Approach to

Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer, Yale HackHealth 2017, New Haven, CT.
Development of a deep learning-based eye-tracking algorithm to improve accuracy of classiﬁcation in lung cancer
imaging and radiology. Eye-tracking enhancements able to improve accuracy of classiﬁcation by 3-5%.
