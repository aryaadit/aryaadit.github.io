Primary Research Interests: 

•  Currently researching parallel Run-Ahead Predictive Simulations (RAPS) using probabilistic risk 
analysis for nuclear power plant control rooms. Developing computer analysis to dynamically 
interpret plant data and predict faster-than-real-time outcomes and risks. 
 

•  Uncertainty/sensitivity analysis of ICRP 26, 60, and 103 tissue weighting factor data; values were 

compared and determined that tissue weighting factors have not statistically changed in 30 
years.  Project culminated with Master of Science degree. 
 

•  Monte Carlo modeling of proton therapy for ocular cancer. Project presented at 2009 Health 

Physics Society Meeting; Pittsburgh, PA.
