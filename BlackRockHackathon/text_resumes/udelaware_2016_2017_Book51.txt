Research and experience  
Furst research group, University of Delaware  
Newark, DE 
Nov 2013–Present 
Studying the formation of non-spherical structured emulsions in microfluidic devices, fo-
cusing on the assembly of hierarchical superstructures from individual anisotropic droplet 
building  blocks  and  modifying  emulsion  droplets  with  surface-adsorbed  and  bulk  parti-
cles. Research focuses strongly on the behavior of colloidal materials and the behavior of 
liquid interfaces. Mentored undergraduate students working on this and other projects. 
 
Field session, Colorado School of Mines 
Golden, CO 
Jul 2012–Aug 2012 
Performed nine experiments ranging from distillation to heat exchanger operation. Led a 
group of three in three of the experiments, presented to a Ph.D. in chemical engineering 
or  chemistry  for  five  experiments,  and  prepared  technical  reports  for  four  experiments. 
Elected by students as the outstanding student of field session.
