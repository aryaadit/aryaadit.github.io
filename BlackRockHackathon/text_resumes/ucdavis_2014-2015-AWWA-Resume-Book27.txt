Project Design Experience – UC Davis 

  Designed a suspended growth biological treatment system and a side-stream reactor for the 
production of PHA using the principles of Green Engineering.  Then a life-cycle assessment of 
this design was done to compare the product made from the processes to similar products. 

  Designed a foundation for a proposed building.  This included the design of design of shallow 

and deep foundations for bearing capacity and settlements, retaining structures, selection and 
evaluation of foundation alternatives, excavation support and dewatering 

  Design an integrated urban drainage system, including realistic constraints, qualification of 

hydrologic uncertainty, codes and standards, design drawings drafting, and cost analysis. 

  Designed appropriate pavements based on a given set of raw data characterizing the traffic, 

materials, and environment.  An appropriate pavement was designed using empirical and 
mechanistic-empirical approaches.
