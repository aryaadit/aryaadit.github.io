I. PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION
Univ. of Pennsylvania, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, minor in energy & sustainability, B.S. Magna Cum Laude (2012) 
Univ. of Delaware (UD), Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Ph.D. under Norman J. Wagner (May 2017, GPA 3.87/4.0)  

II. POSITIONS 
WAGNER RESEARCH GROUP, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark DE 
Graduate Research Assistant at UD (2012-2014) and NIST Center for Neutron Research (2014-present, Gaithersburg, MD) 
Thesis: Structure-property relationships of branched wormlike micelles via rheology and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) 

        

  Employed state-of-the-art, simultaneous time-resolved SANS and non-linear rheology (shear startup, large amplitude 

oscillatory shear) to characterize microstructure and macroscopic flow properties in branched wormlike micelles (WLMs) 
  Developed new time-resolved analysis and data processing methods to improve SANS resolution in space and time while 

reducing scattering time; implemented at NIST and the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL, Grenoble, France) 

  Visiting scientist grant at ILL to develop SANS methods to determination of concentration gradients in flowing systems  

 

WEBER RESEARCH GROUP, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley CA                                                   
Science Undergraduate Laboratory Intern (SULI) in Advanced Energy Technologies (2011) 

  Designed & performed tests on PEM Nafion membranes to study synergistic chemical and mechanical degradation effects  
  Current: Design, implementation of flow-SANS for local concentration changes, shear-induced effects in Nafion solutions 

S. MARGULIES RESEARCH GROUP, Department of Bioengineering, UPenn, Philadelphia PA                
Rachleff Scholars Research Assistant (2010-2011) 

            

  Conducted studies to determine effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on biomarker levels in blood serums of piglets 
  Designed and implemented new protocols; trained future lab employees on biomarker methods
