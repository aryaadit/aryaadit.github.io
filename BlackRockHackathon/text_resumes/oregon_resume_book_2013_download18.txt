Leadership Experience

While working at Western Culinary Institute, I was in charge of a restaurant. The class I taught was the A.M. section
of Restaurant Bleu, a 6-week course that taught students how to work and function in a restaurant environment. It was
here that I learned my skills at leading teams, from 10 to 80 students, how to cook, prepare food, keep a large kitchen
clean and sanitary, and work to Ô¨Ånish tasks on time. This was the class I taught for the duration of my employment at
Western Culinary Institute, and it gave me valuable leadership skills as a result.
