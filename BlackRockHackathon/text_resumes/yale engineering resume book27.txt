M.S.	in	Computer	Science	(expected)	
B.E.	in	Computer	Science	(GPA	3.83/4,	ranked	10%	out	of	196)	
Concentrated	in	Data	Mining,	Information	Retrieval	and	Recommender	Systems	
Received	certificate	from	Chu-Kochen	Honors	College	(5.7%	students	nominated)	
	WORK	EXPERIENCE	
Data	Analytics	Intern	|	Zhuican	Data	Ltd.,	Hangzhou,	China
