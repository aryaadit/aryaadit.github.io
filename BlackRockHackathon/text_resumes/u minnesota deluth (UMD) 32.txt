Projects 

Nerve (neurologically enhanced real-time virtual environment)
Currently working on an undergraduate research project called nerve. The goal of nerve is 
to determine if current consumer brain computer interface (BCI) devices will act as a good 
interface for an immersed virtual environment. Using the campus SIVE (Simulation and 
Interaction in Virtual Environments) lab and the Emotiv Epoc to preform experiments, and 
the Blender Game Engine to create a controllable virtual environment. Project ongoing.
MuVR (multi-user virtual reality)
MuVR is a project with goals to create an immersive virtual reality platform that is easily 
accessible, readily available, self containing, and multi-user. Using exclusively consumer 
products we created a system that is completely worn by the user and is not physically 
connected to anything else. The platform uses an internal tracking algorithm, and hence is 
not dependent on any external localization system. Project ongoing.
Quic Energy
Quic Energy focuses on trying to model how heat and other environmental variables 
propagate through an urban environment. We are working on utilizing massively parallel 
systems to generate large scale simulations in an efficient manner. Project ongoing.
