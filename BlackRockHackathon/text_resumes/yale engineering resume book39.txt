Research and Engineering Experience
Theoretical & Computational Lab for Soft Materials, Yale University
New Haven, CT
Dissertation Research on computational material sciences
Aug 2014 - Present
• Led a research sub-group on a novel material (Bulk Metallic Glasses), presented progress weekly for the other

4 graduate students and 3 professors

• Upgraded a Molecular Dynamics C++ library to simulate micro & macroscopic mechanical properties of glassy
materials with multiple applications in quenching, shear/compression deformation, vibration, bond order
parameter (BOP) analysis, energy minimization, etc

• Carried out three research projects on bulk metallic glasses (BMGs): (1) Glass forming ability; (2) Atomic re-
arrangements and ductility; (3) Shear cycling and vibration. Established a theory for ductility improvement
and collaborated with experimentalists to construct a BMG database

• Analyzed data in large amount with Shell, C++, Matlab and Python. Used HPCs for parallel programming

Center for Combustion Studies, Yale University
New Haven, CT
Special Investigation on combustion
Sept 2013 - Jul 2014
• Modeled with COMSOL (burner build-up, mesh generation, CFD modeling), TECPLOT (post processing) and
CHEMKIN (constitute analysis) to study the effects of nozzle geometry on the velocity field of CH4/O2 coun-
terflow diffusion flames

• Set up and conducted flame extinction and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments of such system

Key Lab for Thermal Science & Power Engineering, Tsinghua University
Beijing, China
Bachelor Thesis Research on combustion
Jan 2013 -Jun 2013
• Calculated flame speed with PREMIX code coupled with different kinetic models on H2/CO/air counterflow
• Conducted Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments of such system

premixed lean flames over a large range of compositions to study the component effects on flame speed

National Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Alberta
Edmonton, AB, Canada
Research Assistant on microfluidics
Aug - Dec 2011
• Designed a microfluidic droplet generation system, conducted experiments and analyzed how surfactant

would affect droplet geometry

• Identified a new self-assembly phenomenon: enclosure of micro-scale oil droplets within an evaporating

sessile water droplet. Developed a hydrodynamic model to describe it with other researchers

Gas Turbine Institute, TurboCFD Lab, Tsinghua University
Beijing, China
Internship on gas turbine aerodynamics
Nov 2010 - June 2011
• Modeled a 1.5-stage axial turbine with AUTO CAD, simulated with NUMECA (a CFD package), and calculated

Mach numbers and pressure throughout the turbine

• Innovated a gas turbine film-cooling blade design with a graduate student and investigated the effects of the

endwall fillet and the attack angle on the film cooling effectiveness experimentally
