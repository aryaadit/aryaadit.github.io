Working as Research assistant under Prof. Suchi Bandarkar for period of Fall 2008-Spring 2009 2.  Worked on a project with University of Illinois and BNSF funded project during my under graduation 3. Secured All India rank 1367 and state rank of 420 in AIEEE 2003 of 97.8 Percentile.   Projects: • HLV Video Encoding (working as part of RA) Description:  Hybrid Layer Video Encoding for Power constrained devices (PDAs, Mobile phones). It is already been proven that power consumption is proportionate to the quality of the video. By generating different states of the Video and experimental results shown these different states take different levels of power consumption.        Guide: Dr. Suchi Bandarkar.     Skills Used: C++, Matlab • Train Monitoring System (University of Illinois and BNSF funded project) Description: Real-Time Project where in we capture a train video from definite view point. Main Challenges here are that detection of double stack, single stack and trailer detection and back ground and foreground separation. Timestamps for each container to be estimated is specific task useful in detection of the container crossed. The accuracy of Timestamps can be cross checked by using RFID tags.        Guide: Dr.Anoop.M.Namboodiri.     Skills Used: C++ • Developed E-Commerce Website Description: As part of Software Engineering course at UGA, we developed E-commerce website to buy & sell and maintain the website by an administrator. We are supposed to have hierarchy of categories and attributes of each category are to be stored as Meta data.       Guide: Dr. Krys. J. Kochut     Skills Used: JSP
