EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

7 years of successful process capability improvement, cost reduction, and team leadership in multiple production and non-
production departments, with the proven capacity to lead cross-functional teams, satisfy stakeholders, and meet or achieve 
required business targets and goals.   During this 7 year span, efforts I led or co-led will have saved over $8 Million by the 
end of 2016.  I’m an adept problem solver and a personable professional; one that possesses a solutions-oriented mindset, 
takes initiative to understand and address problems, makes data-driven decisions, identifies personnel synergies, and uses 
structured problem solving and project management frameworks to maximize the value being delivered.  Currently seeking 
leadership roles in operations, supply chain, process/project management, or management consulting.
