been successfully used at Cree to improve product performance, reduce cost & shorten development time.

 Introduced  Systems  Engineering  approach  to  product  management  at  Cree.  This  has  improved  system

integration and made product development process leaner & robust.

 Using analytical as well as synthetic thinking skills, introduced new approaches to drive product innovation

through cross-functional collaboration.

 At  Engendren,  led  the  cross-functional  teams  to  develop  innovative  modular  data  centers  from  concept  to

production and beyond. I was responsible for design, testing & troubleshooting of the product.

 Won  Business  strategy  competition  organized  by  Navigant  Consulting.  Deliverable  included  thorough
market research, market potential analysis, technology valuation using NPV & Real Options, IP valuation,
marketing strategy & GO/NO-GO recommendation to Board of Directors.

Experience 
Simulation Engineer, Cree, Inc (Racine, WI) 

Apr ‘13 to Present 
Cree, Inc is a manufacturer of lighting fixture category LED products, lighting products and semiconductor 
RF products. I work in the Product Development group of Lighting division.   

Primary  responsibilities 
prototyping to measure, improve and optimize product performance, DFSS, Lean product development 

include  using  virtual  simulation,  advanced  analytical  techniques,  testing, 

 Using FEA & CFD techniques, analyze thermal & structural performance of the lighting fixture

 Creating  optimization  models  using  multi-objective  optimization  programming  to  achieve  product
performance  within  design  constraints.  Such  optimization  models  are  used  to  achieve  structural,
thermal, optical, manufacturing design goals and achieve cost targets simultaneously. This has led to
improved system performance and reduced cost.
