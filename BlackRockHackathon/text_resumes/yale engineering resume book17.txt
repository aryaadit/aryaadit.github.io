Relevant Experience 
Bulldogs Racing, President, Senior Adviser, Mechanical Team Member. Yale University. 2013 - Present 

 

 

  Built BR14 race car as part of the Mechanical Team; 4th place overall in 2014 Formula SAE Hybrid. Engineered the Impact 

Attenuator and front bulkhead to increase their energy absorption potentials from 7.4 kJ to 11.3 kJ (+53%). 

  Envisioned the BR16 project – the first all-electric car of Yale University. Wrote the constitution of the club and conceived 
the management tree of the engineering and business sides. Overhauled the financial structure of the team; increased the 
budget by $20,600 (+64%) by establishing an outreach database of 120+ companies and 500+ alumni. 

  Helped  engineer  the  suspension,  brakes,  cooling,  steering  system  and  tune  the  vehicle  dynamics.  Designed  and 

manufactured the pedal box, mounts for the electric motors, dashboard, headrest and radiator mounts. 

  Advise the team on communication, team-building, decision-making and sustainable growth processes and strategies. 

Schwarz Lab, Undergraduate Researcher. Yale University. 2016 - Present 

  Work on developing an atomic force microscope with a piezoelectric micro-scale tuning fork to obtain atomic resolution. 
  Designed and built a microscope head and stage that allows adjustments within 15 µm (5x finer than hair).  
  Devised a reliable and repeatable method of attaching the tuning fork onto the head and making the electrical connections 

despite a workable area of 0.13 mm2 (0.0002 sq in). 

Katmerciler Heavy Truck Equipment, Intern. Summer 2015, Turkey 

  Designed shelving systems for sheet metal using Solidworks and Finite Element Analysis methods; wrote user manuals 
for the welding robots to improve workflow efficiency at the production planning department. Reported the designs and 
the manuals to the plant manager. 

  Performed Computational Fluid Dynamics analyses to optimize the vacuum pumps in the street sweeper systems (+7% net 
gain) and used Solidworks to design aluminum ballasts to streamline the welding processes on the bodies of the military 
trucks at the research and development department. Reported the findings and the designs to an R&D engineer. 

Freshman Counselor. Yale University. 2016 - Present 

  Advise first year students on topics ranging from academics to emotional well-being to ensure that they have a smooth 
transition. Offer perspectives on interpersonal relations, time management, dealing with stress and navigating social scenes. 

Additional Experience 
ASME Chapter for Undergraduates, President, Vice-President. Yale University. 2014 - 2016 

  Bolstered the connection between STEM-oriented freshmen, upperclassmen and student clubs by organizing joint events.  
  Put together a career panel that brought together engineering academia and professionals to discuss career paths after Yale. 
  Recognized as the “Most Active ASME Member” at Yale University two times in a row, in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. 

Muslim Students’ Association, Information Coordinator. Yale University. 2013 - 2015 
  Maintained the MSA’s website and designed the publicity materials for the weekly events.
