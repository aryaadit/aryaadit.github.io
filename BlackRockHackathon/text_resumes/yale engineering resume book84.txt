Major Thesis Projects 
  Conducted molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of Cr2O3 thin films on ferroelectric LiNbO3 and polar ZnO substrates 

Sep. 2007 - Jun. 2011 

 

 

 

 

in order to study whether a non-polar catalytic film’s surface would be tailored by a polar substrate 

  Used TEM, XRD and XPS to characterize the growth, geometric and electronic structures of Cr2O3 layers; proposed the 

disorder to order interfacial transition through the film evolution 

  Statistically analyzed the ultra-violet spectroscopy (UPS) valence band spectra while observing an enhanced density of 

states near the valence band edge for Cr2O3 on ZnO (0001)  

  Constructed ZnO/Cr2O3/ZnO sandwiches to identify the critical thickness of the Cr2O3 intermediate layer that can pass 

through the ZnO polarization information from the bottom to the top 

  Performed alcohols (e.g., 1-propanol) temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and chemical wet etching to study 

the surface reactivity of the Cr2O3 and ZnO films on multiple substrates systems 

 

Experimental skills 
  Hand on experiences with UHV equipment, troubleshoot >10 critical instrument issues, constructed one MBE chamber 

(2x e-beam evaporators, QCM, Plasma Generator, etc) from scratch semi-independently  

  Practical expertise on precise deposition of sub monolayer to few hundred nanometer thick metal (Pd, Ru) and metal 

oxide films (e.g., Cr2O3, ZnO, IrO2, RuO2, O2 or O plasma assisted) with effusion cells and/or e-beam evaporators 
monitored by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) 

  Good knowledge with operating in-situ XPS/UPS, CMA/hemisphere analyzers and low energy electron diffraction 

(LEED) optics to interpret the chemical nature and surface crystallography of the grown films 

Software skills 
  Familiar with C/C++ and Matlab, integrated a C script in Origin to implement a general least square fitting of two 

random discrete functions for complex UPS and TPD spectra interpretation 

  Experienced with Solidworks designing and testing, independently designed several chamber parts (e.g., X-ray gun 

translation stage) which all works at the first implementation without further alternations
