I am a biomedical engineering undergraduate interested in how innovative, affordable biotechnology can someday expand modern 
healthcare into medically underserved parts of the world, and how an understanding of research science can influence international 
healthcare policy. I have international experience, some laboratory experience, and I am seeking to deepen my understanding for 
the clinical biosciences and how laboratory research can propel our biomedical frontiers, particularly in fields like tissue engineering 
and nanoparticle drug delivery, into a more equitable future.

My interests are at the intersection of biomedicine and international healthcare. I am fascinated by the potential that 
biomaterials and other new sciences offer us, but I'm also committed to finding ways that our technology can employed for 
universal betterment. I pursue opportunities that offer practical insights into the interplay between laboratory research and 
public implementation, with a specific focus on their futures for use in the developing world. I also enjoy being a 
communicator for others, and am confident in my ability to synthesize and express new ideas in clinical or casual settings. I 
volunteer as a tour guide in a campus historical art museum, which is a great way to practice researching and interfacing with 
people, and many of my extracurricular roles have me studying new technologies, medicines, or other ideas and expressing 
them to organize and coordinate a goal.

Major Thesis Projects 
  Conducted molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of Cr2O3 thin films on ferroelectric LiNbO3 and polar ZnO substrates 

Sep. 2007 - Jun. 2011 

 

 

 

 

in order to study whether a non-polar catalytic film’s surface would be tailored by a polar substrate 

  Used TEM, XRD and XPS to characterize the growth, geometric and electronic structures of Cr2O3 layers; proposed the 

disorder to order interfacial transition through the film evolution 

  Statistically analyzed the ultra-violet spectroscopy (UPS) valence band spectra while observing an enhanced density of 

states near the valence band edge for Cr2O3 on ZnO (0001)  

  Constructed ZnO/Cr2O3/ZnO sandwiches to identify the critical thickness of the Cr2O3 intermediate layer that can pass 

through the ZnO polarization information from the bottom to the top 

  Performed alcohols (e.g., 1-propanol) temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and chemical wet etching to study 

the surface reactivity of the Cr2O3 and ZnO films on multiple substrates systems 

 

Experimental skills 
  Hand on experiences with UHV equipment, troubleshoot >10 critical instrument issues, constructed one MBE chamber 

(2x e-beam evaporators, QCM, Plasma Generator, etc) from scratch semi-independently  

  Practical expertise on precise deposition of sub monolayer to few hundred nanometer thick metal (Pd, Ru) and metal 

oxide films (e.g., Cr2O3, ZnO, IrO2, RuO2, O2 or O plasma assisted) with effusion cells and/or e-beam evaporators 
monitored by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) 

  Good knowledge with operating in-situ XPS/UPS, CMA/hemisphere analyzers and low energy electron diffraction 

(LEED) optics to interpret the chemical nature and surface crystallography of the grown films 

Software skills 
  Familiar with C/C++ and Matlab, integrated a C script in Origin to implement a general least square fitting of two 

random discrete functions for complex UPS and TPD spectra interpretation 

  Experienced with Solidworks designing and testing, independently designed several chamber parts (e.g., X-ray gun 

translation stage) which all works at the first implementation without further alternations

• Orthrus Project, Yale University, USA

2014 – 2016
– This project proposes two design principles for multi-core OLTP database systems: separation of database

component functionality and advanced planning of transactions.

– I built a database prototype system Orthrus and experiments show that these two principles alone can signiﬁ-
cantly improve the scalability on high-contention workloads, and an order of magnitude increase in throughput.

• Checkpointing Project, Yale University, USA

2014 – 2016
– This project presents CALC and pCALC, novel methods for asynchronous checkpointing that require minimum

additional memory usage, no physical point of consistency and extremely low runtime overhead.

– Experiments show that CALC and pCALC have an overhead that is 2-10X less than alternative approaches.

• VLL Project, Yale University, USA

2012 – 2014
– This project introduces very lightweight locking(VLL), a protocol for main memory database systems that avoids

the costs of maintaining the data structures kept by traditional lock managers.

– VLL co-locates lock information with the raw data instead of centralizing them. Experiments show that VLL

dramatically reduces lock management overhead.

PERSONAL SUMMARY

E-Mail: alecive87@gmail.com, alessandro.roncone@yale.edu

The central motivating theme of my research is endowing robots with enough communication, perception and
control capabilities in order for them to proficiently interact with humans in practical, near future applications. I
develop technologies that equip robots with the skills to partner with humans in their daily activities, with the aim
of eventually replacing them in dangerous, repetitive or burdensome tasks. Importantly, my goal is not to advance
the state of the art in a specific area. Rather, I explicitly focus on capitalizing the state of the art in perception,
control and human-robot interaction and to shape the research landscape toward the development of technologies
that enable close, natural, extended cooperation with humans.

My research has spanned multiple fields, bridging the gap between robotics, human robot interaction, and
artificial intelligence. Over the years, I have worked on i) exploring the breadths of how tactile systems can improve
perception in the nearby space, ii) implementing state of the art control systems for humanoid robots, and iii)
investigating how communication can steer and improve human-robot collaborative tasks.

RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

2015-present - POSTDOCTORAL ASSOCIATE - SOCIAL ROBOTICS LAB, COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT,
YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CT, USA

I am focusing on the development of bidirectional, natural communication between the robot and the human in
the context of human-robot collaborative tasks. I am working toward the implementation of a more natural and
intuitive interaction, in order for it to be more efficient and effective, as well as less demanding for the human
partner.
2010-2015 - ICUB FACILITY - ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA, GENOVA, IT

I was interested in the exploitation of the peripersonal space model I implemented during my Ph.D., by focusing
toward two types of applications: i) better, richer body representations ii) distributed motor control via whole-body
awareness. Furthermore, I extended the gaze stabilization framework I developed during my Ph.D. by integrating it
with an existing gaze controller. I was also contributing to a human-robot interaction project aimed at developing
natural interaction(s) between the iCub humanoid robot and humans.

resume book

class of 2014

The resumes included in this book are for the students currently enrolled in the Supply Chain 
Management  (SCM)  Program,  a  graduate  level  program  administered  by  the  Center  for 
Transportation & Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology.  Although the program 
is designed for early-career supply chain professionals, the 38 students represented in this book 
hail  from  a  variety  of  backgrounds  and  countries,  including  students  with  experience  in  fields 
such as finance, information, technology, management, marketing and sales. Regardless of their 
backgrounds, all students receive a world-class supply chain management education and also 
complete a thesis-level project with sponsoring companies. 

The SCM program is a ten-month master’s level program where students graduate with a Master 
of Engineering in Logistics from the top program in the field. The program prepares students for 
a  supply  chain  management  career  in  various  industries,  including  consulting,  manufacturing, 
distribution, retail, software, and services. Founded in 1998 by the MIT Center for Transportation & 
Logistics, the SCM program improves its students’ proficiency in both problem solving and change 
leadership.

I  invite  you  to  review  these  resumes  and  contact  me  or  the  students  directly  if  you  have  any 
questions or would like to speak to them further. 

Without further ado, allow me to introduce the MIT Supply Chain Management Class of 2014.

Thank you,

I am a biomedical engineering undergraduate interested in how innovative, affordable biotechnology can someday expand modern 
healthcare into medically underserved parts of the world, and how an understanding of research science can influence international 
healthcare policy. I have international experience, some laboratory experience, and I am seeking to deepen my understanding for 
the clinical biosciences and how laboratory research can propel our biomedical frontiers, particularly in fields like tissue engineering 
and nanoparticle drug delivery, into a more equitable future.

My interests are at the intersection of biomedicine and international healthcare. I am fascinated by the potential that 
biomaterials and other new sciences offer us, but I'm also committed to finding ways that our technology can employed for 
universal betterment. I pursue opportunities that offer practical insights into the interplay between laboratory research and 
public implementation, with a specific focus on their futures for use in the developing world. I also enjoy being a 
communicator for others, and am confident in my ability to synthesize and express new ideas in clinical or casual settings. I 
volunteer as a tour guide in a campus historical art museum, which is a great way to practice researching and interfacing with 
people, and many of my extracurricular roles have me studying new technologies, medicines, or other ideas and expressing 
them to organize and coordinate a goal.

Major Thesis Projects 
  Conducted molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of Cr2O3 thin films on ferroelectric LiNbO3 and polar ZnO substrates 

Sep. 2007 - Jun. 2011 

 

 

 

 

in order to study whether a non-polar catalytic film’s surface would be tailored by a polar substrate 

  Used TEM, XRD and XPS to characterize the growth, geometric and electronic structures of Cr2O3 layers; proposed the 

disorder to order interfacial transition through the film evolution 

  Statistically analyzed the ultra-violet spectroscopy (UPS) valence band spectra while observing an enhanced density of 

states near the valence band edge for Cr2O3 on ZnO (0001)  

  Constructed ZnO/Cr2O3/ZnO sandwiches to identify the critical thickness of the Cr2O3 intermediate layer that can pass 

through the ZnO polarization information from the bottom to the top 

  Performed alcohols (e.g., 1-propanol) temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and chemical wet etching to study 

the surface reactivity of the Cr2O3 and ZnO films on multiple substrates systems 

 

Experimental skills 
  Hand on experiences with UHV equipment, troubleshoot >10 critical instrument issues, constructed one MBE chamber 

(2x e-beam evaporators, QCM, Plasma Generator, etc) from scratch semi-independently  

  Practical expertise on precise deposition of sub monolayer to few hundred nanometer thick metal (Pd, Ru) and metal 

oxide films (e.g., Cr2O3, ZnO, IrO2, RuO2, O2 or O plasma assisted) with effusion cells and/or e-beam evaporators 
monitored by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) 

  Good knowledge with operating in-situ XPS/UPS, CMA/hemisphere analyzers and low energy electron diffraction 

(LEED) optics to interpret the chemical nature and surface crystallography of the grown films 

Software skills 
  Familiar with C/C++ and Matlab, integrated a C script in Origin to implement a general least square fitting of two 

random discrete functions for complex UPS and TPD spectra interpretation 

  Experienced with Solidworks designing and testing, independently designed several chamber parts (e.g., X-ray gun 

translation stage) which all works at the first implementation without further alternations

Selected Projects

• CalvinDB Project, Yale University, USA

2011 – Present
– CalvinDB is a scalable transactional database system that leverages determinism to guarantee active replication

and full ACID-compliance of distributed transactions without two-phase commit.

– CalvinDB was implemented by C/C++. Experiments show that Calvin scales near-linearly and has achieved

near-world record transactional throughput on a simpliﬁed TPC-C benchmark.

– I am the main contributor and source code available to download at https://github.com/yaledb/calvin.

• CavlinFS Project, Yale University, USA

2015 – Present
– CalvinFS leverages the idea of deterministic database system CalvinDB to build a scalable geo-replication meta-

data management layer for large scale distributed ﬁle systems.

– I am the main contributor to build this distributed ﬁle system prototype(CalvinFS) from ground up.

currently working on developing creative ideas to reduce the latency for geo-replication setting.

I am

• Orthrus Project, Yale University, USA

2014 – 2016
– This project proposes two design principles for multi-core OLTP database systems: separation of database

component functionality and advanced planning of transactions.

– I built a database prototype system Orthrus and experiments show that these two principles alone can signiﬁ-
cantly improve the scalability on high-contention workloads, and an order of magnitude increase in throughput.

• Checkpointing Project, Yale University, USA

2014 – 2016
– This project presents CALC and pCALC, novel methods for asynchronous checkpointing that require minimum

additional memory usage, no physical point of consistency and extremely low runtime overhead.

– Experiments show that CALC and pCALC have an overhead that is 2-10X less than alternative approaches.

• VLL Project, Yale University, USA

2012 – 2014
– This project introduces very lightweight locking(VLL), a protocol for main memory database systems that avoids

the costs of maintaining the data structures kept by traditional lock managers.

– VLL co-locates lock information with the raw data instead of centralizing them. Experiments show that VLL

dramatically reduces lock management overhead.

PERSONAL SUMMARY

E-Mail: alecive87@gmail.com, alessandro.roncone@yale.edu

The central motivating theme of my research is endowing robots with enough communication, perception and
control capabilities in order for them to proficiently interact with humans in practical, near future applications. I
develop technologies that equip robots with the skills to partner with humans in their daily activities, with the aim
of eventually replacing them in dangerous, repetitive or burdensome tasks. Importantly, my goal is not to advance
the state of the art in a specific area. Rather, I explicitly focus on capitalizing the state of the art in perception,
control and human-robot interaction and to shape the research landscape toward the development of technologies
that enable close, natural, extended cooperation with humans.

My research has spanned multiple fields, bridging the gap between robotics, human robot interaction, and
artificial intelligence. Over the years, I have worked on i) exploring the breadths of how tactile systems can improve
perception in the nearby space, ii) implementing state of the art control systems for humanoid robots, and iii)
investigating how communication can steer and improve human-robot collaborative tasks.

RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

2015-present - POSTDOCTORAL ASSOCIATE - SOCIAL ROBOTICS LAB, COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT,
YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CT, USA

I am focusing on the development of bidirectional, natural communication between the robot and the human in
the context of human-robot collaborative tasks. I am working toward the implementation of a more natural and
intuitive interaction, in order for it to be more efficient and effective, as well as less demanding for the human
partner.
2010-2015 - ICUB FACILITY - ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI TECNOLOGIA, GENOVA, IT

I was interested in the exploitation of the peripersonal space model I implemented during my Ph.D., by focusing
toward two types of applications: i) better, richer body representations ii) distributed motor control via whole-body
awareness. Furthermore, I extended the gaze stabilization framework I developed during my Ph.D. by integrating it
with an existing gaze controller. I was also contributing to a human-robot interaction project aimed at developing
natural interaction(s) between the iCub humanoid robot and humans.
